# TRIGGERBOT (Work in progress)
A bot for detecting and replying TRIGGERED posts on Facebook using sentiment analysis

## Introduction
I've come across a number of TRIGGERED posts on facebook lately. Facebook just isn't what it used to be. 
This project aims to make facebook great again.
Using my recent education in machine learning and Data Mining, I intend to create a bot which detects triggered posts and simply replies "TRIGGERED" just like the meme we all love
