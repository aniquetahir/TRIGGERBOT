# TRIGGERBOT (Work in progress)
A bot for detecting and replying TRIGGERED posts on Facebook using sentiment analysis

## Introduction
I've come across a number of TRIGGERED posts on facebook lately. Facebook just isn't what it used to be. 
This project aims to **make facebook great again**.
Using my recent knowledge in Machine Learning and Data Mining, I intend to create a bot which detects triggered posts and simply replies "TRIGGERED" just like the meme we all love
